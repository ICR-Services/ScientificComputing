### Service Capabilities and Functions
**High Performamce Computing**: We empower our researchers by providing access to High Performance Computing resources, enabling them to tackle complex computational challenges and accelerate their scientific discoveries.  Our HPC services offer tailored support and infrastructure, facilitating advanced research across diverse disciplines.

**Large Scale Data Storage**: We provide secure and scalable solutions to manage the increasing volumes of data generated by research projects.  These services enable researchers to efficiently store, access, and share their data, facilitating collaboration and accelerating the pace of discovery.

**Research Data Management**: We enable researchers with comprehensive Research Data Management services, including expert support, tailored advice, and practical training to ensure your valuable research data is effectively managed throughout its lifecycle.

**Software development**: We help you turn research ideas into functional software tools, from conception to implementation and deployment. This can be full software development, adaption and enhancement of existing tools, or rapid prototyping. We specialise in creating bespoke user-friendly applications from an assortment of 3rd party command line tools.

**Web application support**: We support and develop both internally facing and externally facing web applications including R-Shiny apps to support publications and dockerised applicaitons tools.

**Application Support**: We support the installation and use of scientific software across the ICR and on Alma, primarily R and python based tools distributed with github or docker but also bioinformatics command line tools.
  
**Software consulting**: We offer guidance on best practices for software development, code review, and software architecture design.

**Research Software Teaching**: We teach the carpentries material to reasearchers at the ICR as well as in-house developed teaching for the platforms.
